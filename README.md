# Hover-Doodle
An Etch-A-Sketch web app. Hover over the canvas to doodle away. Choose colors by clicking on the palette.

## Learning Goals
- get proficient at DOM manipulation with JS
- apply both CSS grid **and** flexbox
- try to make the user experience at least bearable

## Project Plan + Progress so far
- [x] write out the specification
  - there should be a drawing area (divs created in js)
  - user should be able to define the resolution (div amount)
  - user should be able to clear/reset the area
  - (*optional*) add a simple color palette
- [x] draw a simple wireframe/layout sketch ![layout sketch](images/layoutSketch.png)
- [x] create a layout in figma ![figma layout](images/figmaLayout.png)
- [x] structure your html
- [x] write pseudocode for js
- [x] apply basic grid to the web page (color the grid parts) ![colored grid layout in the browser](images/gridBrowserBG.png)
- [x] make sure to leave a grid area for the sketch pad (div), where the js will create 16x16 divs (use flexbox wrap)
- [x] set up a hover effect in JS for the sketch area either by adding a new class or a new background color style
- [x] let the user clear the sketch pad
- [x] let the user choose resolution
- [x] tweak up the css

## Possible things to work on in the future
- starting value of the slider should represent the current resolution
- possibly a Hover Doodle Logo on top of the page
